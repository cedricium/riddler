> _I am a bot of few words, but many riddles._

Riddler is a Slack slash command (`/riddler`) that serves users a single, though-provoking riddle along with an action button to reveal the answer. Big shout-out to Mike Page for listing nearly 250 riddles on his site, https://savagelegend.com/. Also, thanks to CJS from the Noun Project for providing the abstract logo.
